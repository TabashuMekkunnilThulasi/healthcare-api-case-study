# Healthcare Claims API – Case Study (UST Global)

This is a case study based on a real-world project I contributed to during my time at UST Global. It showcases my work on healthcare claims processing using Java Spring Boot, SQL, and AWS.

## 🏢 Organization
**UST Global** – US-based Healthcare Client (Confidential)

## 🎯 Objective
To automate and optimize the processing of healthcare claims through microservice-based APIs, ensuring high availability, scalability, and cloud integration.

## 🔧 Tools & Technologies
- Java, Spring Boot, REST APIs
- MySQL
- AWS S3, Lambda
- Jenkins, Docker
- Postman, JUnit

## 🛠️ My Contributions
- Developed **RESTful APIs** for claim intake, validation, and processing.
- Integrated SQL-based data pipelines with **AWS S3** for scalable storage.
- Participated in **API testing** (unit + regression) and **performance tuning**.
- Designed and implemented **CI/CD pipelines** using Jenkins and Docker.
- Ensured compliance with HIPAA and healthcare data security standards.

## ✅ Impact
- Reduced manual processing by 60%
- Improved system scalability and reliability
- Contributed to faster claims turnaround times for the client
